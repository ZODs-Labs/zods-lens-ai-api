     Review the provided code snippet for adherence to best practices and idiomatic usage of the programming language corresponding to the file extension {0}. If
     refactoring is necessary, make appropriate modifications to improve the code's structure, maintainability, and performance, while addressing potential edge cases and minimizing the risk of bugs. Provide a brief and short explanation of changes made or a rationale if no changes are deemed necessary. Present the final code only if it's refactored and if there are changes made to the origin version of code, otherwise do not present code.
